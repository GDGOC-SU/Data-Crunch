# Data-Crunch

Welcome to the **Data-Crunch** repository! This is the playground for the Data Crunch event under GDGOC SU. Participants will push their code to this repository in separate branches, with each branch named after their team name.

## How to Push Your Code to This Repository

Follow these steps to push your team's code to the repository in a branch named after your team:

### Prerequisites
1. **Git Installed**: Ensure you have Git installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
2. **GitHub Account**: Make sure you have a GitHub account and have access to this repository.
3. **Repository Cloned**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

### Steps to Push Your Code

1. **Clone the Repository** (if not already cloned):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GDGOC-SU/Data-Crunch.git
   cd Data-Crunch 
   ```
2. **Create a New Branch** 
    ```bash
    git checkout -b [teamname]
    ```
    Replace [teamname] with your actual team name (e.g., team-awesome). <br> <br>

3. **Add Your Code**
   Place your code/files in the appropriate directory or create a new folder for your team. <br><br>

4. **Stage Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**
Write a meaningful commit message describing your changes.

```bash
git commit -m "Added code for [teamname]"
```
6. Push Your Branch to GitHub:
Push your branch to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin [teamname]
```
7. **Verify Your Branch**
Go to the GitHub repository and check if your branch has been created and your code is uploaded.

Example
If your team name is `team-awesome`, hereâ€™s how your commands would look:

```bash
git checkout -b team-awesome
git add .
git commit -m "Added code for team-awesome"
git push origin team-awesome
```
**Important Notes**
- Do NOT push to the main branch. Always create and push to your team's branch.

- Ensure your branch name is unique and matches your team name exactly.

- If you encounter any issues, reach out to the event organizers for assistance.
